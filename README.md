Basic 'Characters' script for FiveM

Add `ensure SimpleCharacters` (or whatever you name the folder containing these 2 files) into your **server.cfg** file.

Do not edit, copy or redistribute this script without reading the license or contacting me for permission.

Isn't made for sparkles and shines, it's very basic, but works fine.

Comes with a Config

`Server_Webhook` (STRING) The Webhook link for message logging

`Server_Webhook_Name` (STRING) The Webhook name for message logging

`ChatResourceName` (STRING) What the resource will call itself in chat.

This is how it will show in-game:
